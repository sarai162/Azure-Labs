# Question (AWS Day 32)

The Nautilus Development Team is preparing for a major update to their database infrastructure. To ensure a smooth transition and to safeguard data, the team has requested the DevOps team to take a snapshot of the current RDS instance and restore it to a new instance. This process is crucial for testing and validation purposes before the update is rolled out to the production environment. The snapshot will serve as a backup, and the new instance will be used to verify that the backup process works correctly and that the application can function seamlessly with the restored data.
As a member of the Nautilus DevOps Team, your task is to perform the following:

Take a Snapshot: Take a snapshot of the nautilus-rds RDS instance and name it nautilus-snapshot (please wait nautilus-rds instance to be in available state).

Restore the Snapshot: Restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance named nautilus-snapshot-restore.

Configure the New RDS Instance: Ensure that the new RDS instance has a class of db.t3.micro.

Verify the New RDS Instance: The new RDS instance must be in the Available state upon completion of the restoration process.


# Solution

```

Go to the RDS service in the AWS console.

Make sure the existing RDS instance is in the available state.

Open the instance actions menu and choose Take snapshot.

Give the snapshot the required name and create it.

Wait until the snapshot is fully created.

Select the snapshot and choose Restore snapshot.

Create a new DB instance from it with the required new instance name.

Set the instance class to db.t3.micro.

Keep the remaining settings as needed and start the restore.

Wait until the new RDS instance status changes to available.

```
